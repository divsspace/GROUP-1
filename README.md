Quantifying the Impact of Climate Change on
Agricultural Yield in Odisha Using LSTM and
Random Forest Models

Abstract—Climate change is a serious threat to agricultural
productivity, in particular, climate-sensitive regions like Odisha,
India. This work studies how changing weather patterns are
impacting crop yields across historical climate data and crop
production records for major crops in the state. We show that
using modern machine learning techniques like Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forest (RF)
models, models were built to predict crop yields from various
weather variables as temperature, rainfall, etc. After training and
evaluation, different methods were used for scoring metrics such
as MAE, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2).
One of the methods was Random Forest and given a high score
in all three parameters, it performed much better than LSTM
model. All the metrics showed consistent and reliable results
even when the models had two-dimensional input variables such
as temperature, rainfall, and so on. In addition, the findings
showed the potential consequences of climate scenarios for future
agricultural output.

Climate variability, such as unexpected droughts, unseasonal rainfall, and heatwaves, has a significant impact on agricultural productivity, especially in regions heavily dependent on crop yields like Odisha. This project leverages machine learning techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forest, to predict crop yield losses due to extreme climate variability. The system uses weather data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and other climate sources to train predictive models that forecast potential losses based on historical trends. These predictions are evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R². This system aims to provide actionable insights to farmers by offering real-time alerts and visualizations, helping them take timely measures to mitigate the risks posed by climate fluctuations.
