Agricultural yield prediction requires factoring in both relationships in data as well as its temporal patterns. For the purpose of this study, a dual model approach was employed, wherein a sophisticated regression analysis was performed, utilizing the Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The models were chosen for their sequential learning capabilities, and an attempt was made to navigate the complexities in the overlap of weather and agricultural data through a parallel model implementation, as well as a comprehensive and comparative study of the same. The aim was to provide a fairly accurate representation of the effect both static and dynamic patterns and features can have on agriculture yields.
